Many people make resolutions, especially around New Year's Eve. Why this date is so popular compared to any other day in the calendar year is probably due to the fact that it's considered as a reset, a fresh start, a new opportunity. While I don't find this particularly true, I still somewhat do the same, but for other reasons. Setting new goals for a 1-year timeframe seems the most reasonable to me. It's not too short, allowing me to work on new habits or strengthen those I've already implemented, but also not too long, where the end date is so far in the future that it makes planning hard and impractical. Defining goals for the next 5 years is not helpful, at least for me. They always turn out to be too generic, which I don't prefer.

Despite having so many resolutions at New Year's Eve, most of them turn out to be unmet. Why? Of course, it depends a lot on the person, but the general issue I think is the lack of thought put into the planning. Because goals require actions, and actions need planning. The framework I'll describe below is simply about being conscious at planning and making sure that I keep myself accountable throughout the year, for making the appropriate actions in order to meet my goals. I have a template that I'm reusing each year. It has two main sections. The first is a reflection of the previous year, things that made me happy, proud, grateful and lessons I learned. It looks like this:

- 10 greatest happenings from last year,
- I am most proud of these (at least) three accomplishments from last year,
- three greatest lessons I've learned from last year are,
- three personal improvements I have made in the past year are,
- one word that best sums up and describes last years' experience.

This part is not only good for reminding myself about the good things that have happened to me but will also serve as a reflection point, since ideally it will contain some of the goals I've included in the second section of this document from the previous year, which contains:

- three things I'm really excited about in the next year are,
- three personal improvements I will strive for in the next year are,
- three things I need to do more of in the next year are,
- three things that I need to do less of in the next year are,
- three things I need to stop doing altogether in the next year are.

Here I'm trying not to think about a goal that is too big and has an undefined path to it. I believe that extraordinary things come from well established and productive habits. Although as much as I wish it was possible to be able to manifest a nice house, that's not how it works. But I can do my best to build habits which increase the chances of me being able to buy a nice house one day.

When I finished filling up this template, the planning starts. I will not cover the different ways of building new habits, there's an excellent book for that called [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits). I highly recommend you read it, at least the summary of it. Keeping track of my progress on a daily basis can be done by many applications, I personally use Productive on iOS. But sometimes it's not enough to use such apps. It's too easy to skip a day. Then days become weeks, weeks become months and so on. At one point, one will start fully ignoring the app, maybe even deleting it. Everyone does this, I've done it many times as well. The issue is that there's no real "punishment", so it's very easy to just not do it.

To solve this, I've decided to set up a reminder every 3 months, where I sit down and review that period. Did I make progress and managed to get closer to my goals? Good, let's keep going! Did I get stuck at one point? Let's analyze it and see why it happened. Usually, it happens simply due to laziness. The power of this method is that I have a special kind of reminder which does not happen daily. Skipping this review, or even realizing during the review that I've deleted my habit tracker app on day 5, will make me ashamed of myself, since I've just "wasted" 3 months of my life. This helps to keep myself accountable and to make sure that I am still on the right path to meet my goals.

This framework is far from perfect and I'm making small changes to it all the time. But it should serve as an idea of what could be done in order to become your best version in the upcoming year.
