Ledger's newest hardware wallet called [Stax](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-stax) has been announced at the company's internal conference, Op3n.  They are claiming that "this is going to change everything" - at least for crypto. But is this actually the case? Who is the target audience of this product, and can we consider this as an improvement overall?

Here is a quick rundown of Stax's features, designed by Tony Fadell, an ex-Apple employee who played a major role in the creation of the iPod:

- Bluetooth 5.2
- E Ink touchscreen
- Wireless charging
- Supporting 5000+ coins
- NFTs
- Compatible with macOS, Windows, iOS, Android

Let's compare it to Ledger's previous flagship product, the Nano X. You get a touchscreen, so you no longer have to navigate through the options via physical buttons - which can be painful at times. It also uses a technology called E Ink, which might be familiar for the eBook community. Supporting gazillion different coins and having a Bluetooth support is nothing new.

But you can finally show off your NFTs to your family and friends. Which is awesome, right? Right?!

First of all, the majority of the NFTs are built in a way so that they can't be displayed on a static E Ink screen properly. To solve this, Ledger will provide a method to add additional metadata to your NFTs, basically creating a "copy" which can be displayed on your Stax nicely. So now you can go around with your hardware wallet and show either a copy of your NFT or a black and white version of it. My question is: if you can't show the original piece, why show it in the first place?

Second of all, hardware wallets are not meant to be carried around, they are meant to be discreet gadgets stored at safe locations. People investing in hardware wallets usually have a portfolio worth just enough to make its owners want to leave it at home, or whichever place they find safe enough. I believe this defeats the main selling point of the Stax: its display. Yes, having a touchscreen makes navigation easier and it is certainly more intuitive, but since people are not using their wallets on a day-to-day basis, I would not consider this as revolutionary. An improvement indeed, but claiming that "this is going to change everything" is a bit of an exaggeration.

I still believe this is a good product. Although dealing with a hardware wallet that looks like a USB stick might not be an issue for me, I have to admit that for the majority of the people, having to press even one button can make it unattractive. This is a problem, since our goal should be to convince as many people as possible about the benefits of self-custody - until we figure out a way to make CEXs trustable. I am quite confident about the fact that Stax will attract a new set of customers, who previously stored all their assets on centralized exchanges, since they found the alternatives unintuitive and ugly. The more available options we have, the better.
